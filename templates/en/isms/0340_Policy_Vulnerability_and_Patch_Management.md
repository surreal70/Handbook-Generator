# Policy: Vulnerability and Patch Management

<!-- 
TEMPLATE AUTHOR NOTE:
This policy establishes the principles for vulnerability and patch management.
It ensures that technical vulnerabilities are identified, assessed, and remediated
in a timely manner. Customize based on your organization's patch management
maturity and risk tolerance.

## 1. Purpose

This policy defines the principles for vulnerability and patch management at **{{ meta.organization.name }}**. It ensures that technical vulnerabilities are identified, assessed, and remediated in a timely manner to minimize the risk of security incidents.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to:

- **Organizational Units:** All departments and locations of {{ meta.organization.name }}
- **Systems:** All IT systems, applications, operating systems, network components, firmware
- **Vulnerability Types:** Software vulnerabilities, configuration errors, missing patches
- **Environments:** Production, test, development, cloud, on-premise
- **Locations:** {{ netbox.site.name }} and all other operational sites

**Exceptions:** Exceptions are only permitted through the defined exception process (`0640_Policy_Exceptions_and_Risk_Waivers.md`).

## 3. Principles (Policy Statements)

### 3.1 Proactive Vulnerability Identification
Vulnerabilities are proactively identified through regular vulnerability scans, penetration tests, and security assessments.

### 3.2 Risk-Based Prioritization
Vulnerabilities are prioritized by risk (CVSS score, exploitability, impact, exposure). Critical vulnerabilities have highest priority.

### 3.3 Timely Remediation
Vulnerabilities are remediated within defined SLAs:
- **Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0):** 7 days
- **High (CVSS 7.0-8.9):** 30 days
- **Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9):** 90 days
- **Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9):** 180 days or based on risk assessment

### 3.4 Patch Management Lifecycle
Patches are deployed through a structured process:
- **Identification:** Monitoring of vendor security bulletins
- **Assessment:** Risk and impact analysis
- **Testing:** Validation in test environment
- **Deployment:** Controlled rollout to production
- **Verification:** Confirmation of successful installation

### 3.5 Emergency Patching
For critical zero-day vulnerabilities or actively exploited exploits, an accelerated emergency patch process exists.

### 3.6 Compensating Controls
When patches cannot be applied immediately, compensating controls are implemented (e.g., network segmentation, WAF rules, IPS signatures).

### 3.7 Vulnerability Disclosure
Vulnerabilities in own products or services are disclosed responsibly (responsible disclosure).

### 3.8 Continuous Monitoring
Systems are continuously monitored for new vulnerabilities. Automated scanning tools are deployed.

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities

## 6. Compliance, Monitoring and Enforcement

### Metrics and KPIs
- Number of open vulnerabilities by severity
- Mean time to remediate (MTTR)
- Patch compliance rate (target: 95% within SLA)
- Number of overdue patches
- Number of emergency patches per quarter
- Vulnerability scan coverage (target: 100% of critical systems)

### Evidence and Proof
- Vulnerability scan reports
- Patch deployment logs
- Remediation evidence
- Compensating controls documentation
- Penetration test reports
- Patch compliance audit reports

### Consequences of Violations
Violations of this policy are handled according to applicable HR and compliance processes:
- **Unpatched critical systems:** Immediate remediation, investigation
- **SLA violations:** Escalation, remediation plan
- **Unauthorized patching:** Rollback, retraining
- **Repeated violations:** Employment consequences

## 7. Exceptions

Exceptions to this policy are only permitted in justified cases:

- **Exception Process:** See `0640_Policy_Exceptions_and_Risk_Waivers.md`
- **Approval:** Exceptions must be approved by CISO and System Owner
- **Documentation:** All exceptions are documented in the risk register
- **Time Limitation:** Exceptions are generally time-limited
- **Compensating Controls:** Exceptions require alternative security measures
