## Purpose

This document describes the "Continual improvement" principle of ISO 31000 risk management. Risk management is continually improved through learning and experience.

## Principle Description

Risk management is continually improved through learning and experience. Organizations should develop and implement strategies to improve their risk management maturity along with all other aspects of their organization.

### Key Statements

- Risk management is a continuous process
- Learning from experiences is central
- Maturity development is pursued
- Adaptation to new insights
- Systematic improvement

## Implementation in {{ meta-organisation.name }}

### Continuous Improvement Cycle

**PDCA Cycle in Risk Management:**

1. **Plan**
   - Define risk management objectives
   - Identify improvement potentials
   - Plan measures

2. **Do**
   - Implement improvement measures
   - Test new methods
   - Conduct training

3. **Check**
   - Measure effectiveness
   - Analyze results
   - Identify deviations

4. **Act**
   - Make adjustments
   - Standardize best practices
   - Document lessons learned

### Learning Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Lessons learned | Systematic evaluation of experiences |
| Post-incident reviews | Analysis after risk events |
| Benchmarking | Comparison with best practices |
| Audits and assessments | External evaluations |
| Feedback loops | Continuous feedback |

## Maturity Model

### Risk Management Maturity Levels

**Level 1 - Initial:**
- Ad-hoc risk management
- No standardized processes
- Reactive approach

**Level 2 - Repeatable:**
- Basic processes established
- Documented procedures
- Repeatable practices

**Level 3 - Defined:**
- Standardized processes
- Organization-wide application
- Integrated risk management

**Level 4 - Managed:**
- Quantitative control
- Measurable objectives
- Proactive management

**Level 5 - Optimizing:**
- Continuous optimization
- Innovation and improvement
- Anticipatory management

**Current Maturity Level:** {{ meta-handbook.risk_maturity_level }}  
**Target Maturity Level:** {{ meta-handbook.target_risk_maturity_level }}

## Improvement Measures

### Identification of Improvement Potentials

**Sources for Improvements:**
- Internal audits
- External assessments
- Stakeholder feedback
- Incident analyses
- Industry developments
- Regulatory changes

### Prioritization of Improvements

**Criteria:**
- Impact on risk management effectiveness
- Resource requirements
- Urgency

- Cost-benefit ratio

## Measuring Improvement

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- Risk management maturity level
- Number of identified risks
- Effectiveness of risk mitigation measures
- Time spent on risk processes
- Stakeholder satisfaction
- Number of realized risks
- Cost of risk events

### Success Measurement

**Annual Assessment:**
- Review of risk management framework
- Analysis of objective achievement
- Assessment of process efficiency
- Identification of improvement potentials
- Planning for next year
