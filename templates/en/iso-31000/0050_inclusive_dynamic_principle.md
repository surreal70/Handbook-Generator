## Purpose

This document describes the "Inclusive" and "Dynamic" principles of ISO 31000 risk management.

## Principle 4: Inclusive

### Description

Appropriate and timely involvement of stakeholders enables their knowledge, views, and perceptions to be considered. This results in improved awareness and informed risk management.

### Key Statements

- Stakeholders are actively involved
- Different perspectives are considered
- Knowledge and experience are utilized
- Transparency and trust are promoted

### Stakeholder Engagement in {{ meta-organisation.name }}

| Stakeholder Group | Engagement Method |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Board | Risk governance committee |
| Management | Risk management meetings |
| Employees | Risk workshops, surveys |
| Customers | Feedback mechanisms |
| Suppliers | Risk assessments |
| Regulators | Compliance reporting |

## Principle 5: Dynamic

### Description

Risks can emerge, change, or disappear as external and internal contexts change. Risk management anticipates, detects, acknowledges, and responds to those changes and events in an appropriate and timely manner.

### Key Statements

- Risk management responds to changes
- Continuous monitoring of environment
- Early warning systems for new risks
- Flexible adaptation of measures

### Dynamic Risk Management in {{ meta-organisation.name }}

**Monitoring Mechanisms:**
1. Continuous environment observation
2. Regular risk assessments
3. Early warning indicators
4. Scenario analyses
5. Lessons learned processes

**Adaptation Processes:**
- Quarterly risk reviews
- Ad-hoc assessment for significant events
- Annual update of risk management framework
- Continuous improvement of methods

## Integration of Both Principles

The combination of inclusive and dynamic risk management enables:
- Early detection of changes through stakeholder input
- Quick response through broad knowledge base
- Acceptance of measures through involvement
- Continuous improvement through feedback
