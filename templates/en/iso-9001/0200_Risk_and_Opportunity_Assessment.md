TEMPLATE AUTHOR NOTE:
This template documents the process for addressing risks and opportunities
according to ISO 9001:2015 Clause 6.1.
The organization must determine risks and opportunities that need to be addressed
to ensure the QMS achieves intended results, enhance desirable effects, prevent
or reduce undesired effects, and achieve improvement.

Customization required:
- Define risk assessment methodology
- Identify risks and opportunities related to QMS
- Assess and prioritize risks
- Define risk treatment actions
- Establish monitoring and review process
- Link to context analysis and interested parties

Reference: ISO 9001:2015, Clause 6.1

## Purpose

This document defines the process for determining and addressing risks and opportunities that can affect the ability of the QMS to achieve its intended results, in accordance with ISO 9001:2015 Clause 6.1.

## Risk Management Framework

### Risk Management Approach

{{ meta.organization }} uses a systematic approach to identify, assess, and treat risks and opportunities related to the QMS.

**Risk Management Methodology:** [TODO: e.g., ISO 31000, FMEA, risk matrix]

### Scope of Risk Assessment

Risk assessment covers:

- **Products and services:** Risks affecting conformity and customer satisfaction
- **External context:** Risks from external issues (Clause 4.1)
- **Internal context:** Risks from internal issues (Clause 4.1)
- **Interested parties:** Risks related to stakeholder requirements (Clause 4.2)

## Risk and Opportunity Identification

### Sources of Risks and Opportunities

Risks and opportunities are identified from:
- Context analysis (Clause 4.1)
- Interested parties requirements (Clause 4.2)

- Nonconformities and complaints
- Market and technology changes
- Regulatory changes
- Performance data and trends

### Risk Categories

## Risk Assessment Process

### Risk Identification Workshops

**Frequency:** [TODO: e.g., annually, semi-annually]

**Participants:**
- Top Management
- Quality Manager
- Process Owners
- Subject matter experts

**Method:** [TODO: e.g., brainstorming, SWOT analysis, PESTEL analysis]

### Risk Analysis

Each identified risk is analyzed for:

**Likelihood:** Probability of occurrence
- **High:** Likely to occur (>50% probability)
- **Medium:** May occur (10-50% probability)
- **Low:** Unlikely to occur (<10% probability)

**Impact:** Consequence if risk occurs
- **High:** Severe impact on QMS objectives, customer satisfaction, or compliance
- **Medium:** Moderate impact, manageable with effort
- **Low:** Minor impact, easily managed

### Risk Evaluation

**Risk Level = Likelihood × Impact**

| Likelihood | Low Impact | Medium Impact | High Impact |
|------------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| High | Medium | High | Critical |
| Medium | Low | Medium | High |
| Low | Low | Low | Medium |

**Risk Priorities:**
- **Critical:** Immediate action required
- **High:** Action required within [TODO: timeframe]
- **Medium:** Action required within [TODO: timeframe]
- **Low:** Monitor, action if needed

## Risk Register

### Risk Documentation

Each risk is documented with:
- **Risk ID:** Unique identifier
- **Risk description:** Clear description of the risk
- **Risk category:** Strategic, operational, compliance, reputational
- **Risk owner:** Person responsible for managing the risk
- **Likelihood:** High / Medium / Low
- **Impact:** High / Medium / Low
- **Risk level:** Critical / High / Medium / Low
- **Current controls:** Existing controls or mitigation measures
- **Treatment plan:** Planned actions to address risk
- **Status:** Open / In progress / Closed
- **Review date:** Next review date
