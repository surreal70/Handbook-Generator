TEMPLATE AUTHOR NOTE:
This template documents design and development according to ISO 9001:2015 Clause 8.3.
Reference: ISO 9001:2015, Clause 8.3
-->

## Purpose

This document defines how {{ meta.organization }} designs and develops products and services to ensure they meet requirements.

## Design Planning (8.3.2)

### Development Process

**{{ meta.organization }} plans and controls design and development by:**
- Determining design and development stages
- Determining required reviews and validations
- Defining responsibilities and authorities
- Considering resource needs
- Controlling interfaces between involved persons
- Involving customers and users
- Requirements for subsequent provision
- Expected level of control
- Documented information as evidence

### Development Phases

**Typical Development Phases:**

| Phase | Activities | Outputs | Responsible |
|-------|------------|---------|-------------|
| 1. Concept | Ideation, feasibility study | Concept document | [TODO] |
| 2. Planning | Requirements analysis, project plan | Specification, project plan | [TODO] |
| 3. Design | Detailed design, specifications | Design drawings | [TODO] |
| 4. Development | Prototype building, tests | Prototype, test reports | [TODO] |
| 5. Validation | Validation tests, release | Validation report | [TODO] |
| 6. Launch | Production ramp-up, market launch | Series product | [TODO] |

## Design Inputs (8.3.3)

### Input Requirements

**{{ meta.organization }} determines requirements essential for specific types of products and services:**
- Functional and performance requirements
- Information from previous similar developments
- Statutory and regulatory requirements
- Standards or codes of practice
- Potential consequences of failure
- Customer-specific requirements

### Input Documentation

**Design inputs documented in:**
- Requirements specification
- Customer specifications
- Technical requirements
- Regulatory requirements

**Inputs must be:**
- Complete
- Unambiguous
- Not contradictory
- Verifiable

## Design Controls (8.3.4)

### Control Measures

**{{ meta.organization }} applies controls to ensure:**
- Results to be achieved are defined
- Reviews are conducted
- Validations are conducted
- Responsibilities and authorities are defined
- Internal and external resource needs are considered
- Interfaces are controlled
- Customers and users are involved
- Requirements are met
- Problems are resolved
- Documented information is retained

### Design Reviews

**Regular design reviews at each phase:**
- **Participants:** [TODO: e.g., Development, Quality, Production, Sales]
- **Frequency:** [TODO: e.g., At end of each phase]
- **Criteria:** Achievement of phase objectives

**Review Checklist:**
- Are all requirements considered?
- Are risks identified and assessed?
- Are solutions technically feasible?
- Are resources available?
- Is schedule realistic?

## Design Outputs (8.3.5)

### Output Requirements

**{{ meta.organization }} ensures design outputs:**
- Meet input requirements
- Are adequate for subsequent processes
- Include monitoring and measurement requirements
- Specify acceptance criteria
- Specify characteristics for safe and proper provision

### Output Documentation

**Design outputs documented in:**
- Technical drawings
- Specifications
- Bills of materials (BOM)
- Work instructions
- Inspection instructions
- Packaging instructions

## Design Changes (8.3.6)

### Change Management

**{{ meta.organization }} identifies, reviews, and controls changes during or after design and development:**
- Changes are documented
- Impacts are assessed
- Changes are reviewed and approved
- Actions to prevent adverse impacts are taken
- Documented information is retained

### Change Process

**Steps in change process:**
1. Submit change request
2. Assess change (technical, cost, schedule)
3. Conduct impact analysis
4. Approve/reject change
5. Implement change
6. Verify change
7. Update documentation
8. Inform affected parties

**Change Request Form:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Change ID | Unique identifier |
| Requestor | Name and date |
| Description | What should be changed? |
| Justification | Why is change necessary? |
| Impacts | Technical, cost, schedule |
| Approval | Name, signature, date |

## Verification and Validation

### Verification (8.3.4)

**Verification ensures design outputs meet input requirements:**
- **Methods:** Calculations, comparisons, tests, alternative designs
- **Timing:** At end of each development phase
- **Documentation:** Verification reports

### Validation (8.3.4)

**Validation ensures products/services meet intended application:**
- **Methods:** Field tests, pilot production, customer tests
- **Timing:** Before delivery or implementation
- **Documentation:** Validation reports

**Validation Criteria:**
- Functionality under real conditions
- Usability
- Reliability
- Safety
- Performance

## Development Documentation

### Required Documentation

**For each development project:**
- Development plan
- Requirements specification
- Design documents
- Verification and validation reports
- Change logs
- Release documentation

### Document Retention

**Development documentation retained for:**
- [TODO: e.g., Product lifetime + X years]

## Responsibilities

### Development Manager

- Overall responsibility for development projects
- Approval of development plans
- Resource allocation
- Progress monitoring

### Development Team

- Conducting development activities
- Creating design outputs
- Participating in reviews
- Documentation

### Quality Management
