TEMPLATE AUTHOR NOTE:
This template describes the QMS and its processes according to ISO 9001:2015 Clause 4.4.
It defines required processes, their sequence, interaction, and criteria for effective operation and control.

Customization required:
- Identify all QMS processes (management, core, support)
- Define process sequence and interactions
- Establish criteria and methods for effective operation
- Determine resources and information needed
- Define monitoring, measurement, and analysis methods
- Implement actions for achieving objectives and continual improvement
- Document outsourced processes and their controls

## Purpose

This document describes the quality management system and its processes according to ISO 9001:2015 Clause 4.4. It defines the required processes, their sequence, interaction, and the criteria for their effective operation and control.

## QMS Process Approach

### Process Model

The organization applies a process approach that includes the following elements:
- Identification of processes required for the QMS
- Determination of the sequence and interaction of these processes
- Determination of criteria and methods for effective operation and control
- Ensuring availability of resources and information
- Monitoring, measurement, and analysis of processes
- Implementation of actions to achieve objectives and continual improvement

### Process Categories

**1. Management Processes:**
- Strategic planning and objective setting
- Management review
- Internal audit
- Continual improvement

**2. Core Processes:**
- [TODO: Product development]
- [TODO: Production/Service provision]
- [TODO: Sales and customer management]

**3. Support Processes:**
- Human resources management
- Resource management
- Document management
- IT management

## Process Interactions

### Process Map

[TODO: Insert process map here or refer to appendix]

The process map shows:
- All QMS processes
- Process sequence and hierarchy
- Main interfaces between processes
- Inputs and outputs
- External interfaces (customers, suppliers)

### Interface Matrix

| From Process | To Process | Interface/Handover | Responsible |
