# Architecture Framework Setup

## Purpose

This document describes the setup and customization of the TOGAF Architecture Framework for {{ source.organization_name }}. It defines how TOGAF will be tailored to meet organizational needs and integrated with existing processes.

## Scope

This document covers:
- Framework customization approach
- Integration with existing methodologies
- Roles and responsibilities
- Tools and repository setup
- Governance structure

## Framework Customization

### Tailoring Approach

{{ source.organization_name }} will tailor TOGAF to align with:
- Organizational culture and structure
- Existing processes and methodologies
- Industry-specific requirements
- Regulatory and compliance obligations

### Framework Components

The following TOGAF components will be implemented:

| Component | Implementation Status | Customization Notes |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Architecture Development Method (ADM) | {{ source.adm_status }} | {{ source.adm_notes }} |
| Architecture Content Framework | {{ source.content_framework_status }} | {{ source.content_notes }} |
| Enterprise Continuum | {{ source.continuum_status }} | {{ source.continuum_notes }} |
| Architecture Repository | {{ source.repository_status }} | {{ source.repository_notes }} |
| Architecture Capability Framework | {{ source.capability_status }} | {{ source.capability_notes }} |

## Integration with Existing Methodologies

### Current Methodologies

{{ source.organization_name }} currently uses:
- {{ source.existing_methodology_1 }}
- {{ source.existing_methodology_2 }}
- {{ source.existing_methodology_3 }}

### Integration Strategy

The TOGAF framework will be integrated with existing methodologies through:
- Mapping of deliverables and artifacts
- Alignment of governance processes
- Harmonization of terminology
- Coordinated planning cycles

## Architecture Capability

### Organizational Structure

The architecture function is positioned within: {{ source.architecture_org_position }}

### Maturity Assessment

Current architecture maturity level: {{ source.architecture_maturity_level }}

Target architecture maturity level: {{ source.target_maturity_level }}

## Tools and Technology

### Architecture Tools

| Tool Category | Tool Name | Purpose |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| Modeling Tool | {{ source.modeling_tool }} | Architecture modeling and visualization |
| Repository | {{ source.repository_tool }} | Architecture artifact storage |
| Collaboration | {{ source.collaboration_tool }} | Team collaboration and review |
| Documentation | {{ source.documentation_tool }} | Document generation and publishing |

## Success Criteria

The framework setup will be considered successful when:
- All stakeholders understand their roles in the architecture process
- Architecture repository is operational
- Initial architecture artifacts are created
- Governance processes are established
- Training is completed for architecture team
