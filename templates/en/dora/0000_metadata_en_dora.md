## About DORA Metrics

DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) Metrics are scientifically validated performance indicators for software delivery performance. The four key metrics measure:

1. **Deployment Frequency** - How often code is deployed to production
2. **Lead Time for Changes** - Time from commit to production
3. **Mean Time to Restore (MTTR)** - Time to recover from incidents
4. **Change Failure Rate** - Percentage of failed deployments

These metrics help organizations assess their DevOps maturity and identify continuous improvement opportunities.
