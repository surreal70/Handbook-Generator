## Overview

The Service Directory framework provides templates and structures for documenting IT services within an organization. This framework supports service catalog management and service documentation.

## Framework Structure

The Service Directory framework uses a hierarchical structure with subdirectories for different service types:

### Service Templates

Located in `service-templates/`:
- `service_description_template.md` - Standard template for documenting IT services

### Example Services

Located in `email-service/`:
- Example service documentation demonstrating the use of service templates

## Purpose

This framework enables:
- Standardized service documentation
- Service catalog management
- Consistent service descriptions across the organization
- Integration with ITSM processes

## Usage

1. Use the service description template as a starting point
2. Customize for specific service types
3. Maintain service documentation in the service directory structure
4. Reference services from other frameworks (e.g., ISMS, BCM)

## Integration with Other Frameworks

The Service Directory integrates with:
- **ISMS**: Services are assets that need protection
- **BCM**: Services are part of business continuity planning
- **IT Operations**: Services define operational requirements
