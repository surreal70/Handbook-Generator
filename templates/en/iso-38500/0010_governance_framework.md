## IT Governance according to ISO/IEC 38500

ISO/IEC 38500 defines IT governance as the system by which the current and future use of IT is directed and controlled. IT governance involves evaluating and directing the use of IT to support the organization and monitoring its use to achieve plans.

### Governance Objectives

1. **Value Creation**: IT should create value for the organization
2. **Risk Management**: IT-related risks should be appropriately managed
3. **Resource Optimization**: IT resources should be used efficiently
4. **Compliance**: IT should meet legal and regulatory requirements
5. **Strategic Alignment**: IT should support business strategy

## Governance Model

### Evaluate-Direct-Monitor (EDM)

The EDM model forms the core of IT governance:

- **Evaluate**: Assessment of current and future IT use
- **Direct**: Preparation and communication of plans and policies
- **Monitor**: Monitoring of compliance with policies and performance

## Six Governance Principles

1. **Responsibility**: Clear responsibilities for IT decisions
2. **Strategy**: IT strategy supports business strategy
3. **Acquisition**: IT acquisitions are appropriate and justified
4. **Performance**: IT delivers required performance
5. **Conformance**: IT meets all obligations
6. **Human Behavior**: IT respects human needs
