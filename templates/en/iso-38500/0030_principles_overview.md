## The Six Principles

### 1. Responsibility

Individuals and groups within the organization understand and accept their responsibilities regarding both supply and demand of IT. Those with responsibility have the authority to fulfill it.

**Key Message**: Clear responsibilities for IT decisions and actions

### 2. Strategy

The organization's IT strategy takes into account the current and future capabilities of IT and the strategic needs of the business. Strategic plans for IT meet the current and ongoing needs of the business strategy.

**Key Message**: IT strategy supports and enables business strategy

### 3. Acquisition

IT acquisitions are made for valid reasons, based on appropriate and ongoing analysis, with clear and transparent decisions. There is an appropriate balance between benefits, opportunities, costs, and risks, both short-term and long-term.

**Key Message**: IT acquisitions are appropriately justified and validated

### 4. Performance

IT is fit for purpose to support the organization by providing the required services, service levels, and service quality to meet current and future business requirements.

**Key Message**: IT delivers required performance to support the organization

### 5. Conformance

IT complies with all mandatory legislation and regulations. Policies and practices are clearly defined, implemented, and enforced.

**Key Message**: IT meets all external and internal obligations

### 6. Human Behavior

IT policies, practices, and decisions demonstrate respect for human behavior, including the current and evolving needs of all "people in the process".

**Key Message**: IT respects the needs of all stakeholders
