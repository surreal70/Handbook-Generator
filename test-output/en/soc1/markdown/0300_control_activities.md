## Purpose

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the service organization's control activities in accordance with the COSO Internal Control Framework and Trust Services Criteria CC6.

## Scope

This document covers:
- Types of control activities
- Control design and implementation
- Technology controls
- Policies and procedures
- Control monitoring

## Overview

Control activities are the actions established through policies and procedures that help ensure that management directives to mitigate risks to the achievement of objectives are carried out. Control activities are performed at all levels of the organization, at various stages within business processes, and over the technology environment.

## Types of Control Activities

### Preventive Controls

**Purpose**: Prevent errors or fraud before they occur

**Examples**:

[TODO]

### Detective Controls

**Purpose**: Identify errors or fraud after they have occurred

**Examples**:
- Reconciliations
- Reviews and approvals
- Analytical procedures
- Exception reports
- Monitoring activities

[TODO]

### Corrective Controls

**Purpose**: Correct identified errors or problems

**Examples**:
- Error correction procedures
