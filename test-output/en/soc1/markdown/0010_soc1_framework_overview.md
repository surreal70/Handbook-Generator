## SOC 1 Framework

### Overview

SOC 1 (Service Organization Control 1) reports are attestation reports on a service organization's controls that are relevant to user organizations' financial reporting.

### SSAE 18 Standard

SSAE 18 (Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 18) is the attestation standard that defines the requirements for SOC 1 reports.

**Core Elements**:
- Management Assertion
- Service Auditor's Report
- System Description
- Control Objectives and Related Controls
- Tests of Controls and Results

### Report Types

**Type I Report**:
- Description of the system at a point in time
- Assessment of control design suitability
- No tests of operating effectiveness

**Type II Report**:
- Description of the system over a period (minimum 6 months)
- Assessment of control design suitability
- Tests of operating effectiveness of controls
- Detailed test results

### COSO Framework Integration

SOC 1 reports are based on the COSO Internal Control Framework with five components:

1. **Control Environment**
2. **Risk Assessment**
3. **Control Activities**
4. **Information and Communication**
