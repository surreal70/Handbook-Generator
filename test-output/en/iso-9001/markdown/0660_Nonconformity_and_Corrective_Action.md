## Purpose

This document defines how AdminSend GmbH deals with nonconformities and implements corrective actions to prevent recurrence.

## Reaction to Nonconformity (10.2.1)

### Identification

**Nonconformities identified through:**
- Incoming inspection
- Production inspection
- Final inspection
- Customer complaints
- Internal audits
- External audits
- Process monitoring
- Employee observations

### Immediate Actions

**When nonconformity occurs:**
1. **React:** Take immediate actions to control and correct
2. **Evaluate:** Assess consequences
3. **Act:** Take actions to:
   - Correct the nonconformity
   - Deal with consequences
   - Prevent use/delivery

### Nonconformity Report

**Report contains:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| NC Number | Unique identifier |
| Date | Detection date |
| Reporter | Person who detected NC |
| Area | Affected area/process |
| Description | Detailed description of NC |
| Category | [TODO: e.g., Product, Process, System] |
| Severity | [TODO: e.g., Critical, Major, Minor] |
| Affected Quantity | Number/extent |
| Immediate Action | Immediate action taken |
| Status | Open/In Progress/Closed |

## Root Cause Analysis (10.2.1)

### Analysis Methods

**AdminSend GmbH uses:**
- 5-Why Method
- Ishikawa Diagram (Fishbone Diagram)
- Failure-Cause Analysis
- Pareto Analysis
- Fault Tree Analysis
- 8D Method (for complex problems)

### 5-Why Method

**Example:**
1. Why did NC occur? [TODO: Answer]
2. Why? [TODO: Answer]
3. Why? [TODO: Answer]
4. Why? [TODO: Answer]
5. Why? [TODO: Root cause]

### Ishikawa Diagram

**Categories:**
- Man (Personnel)
- Machine (Equipment)
- Material
- Method (Process)
- Measurement
- Environment (Milieu)

### Cause Documentation

**Document:**
- Identified causes
- Analysis method used
- Persons involved
- Date of analysis
- Root cause(s)

## Corrective Actions (10.2.1)

### Action Planning

**Corrective actions must:**
- Address root cause
- Be appropriate for effects
- Prevent recurrence
- Be feasible
- Be measurable

**Action Plan:**

| Action | Responsible | Due Date | Resources | Status |
|--------|-------------|----------|-----------|--------|
| [TODO] | [TODO] | [TODO] | [TODO] | [TODO] |

### Action Types

**Distinction:**
- **Correction:** Elimination of detected NC (immediate action)
- **Corrective Action:** Elimination of cause to prevent recurrence

**Examples of Corrective Actions:**
- Process changes
- Training
- Change of work instructions
- Equipment improvement
- Change of specifications
- Enhanced monitoring

## Implementation of Actions (10.2.1)

### Implementation

**Steps:**
1. Approve actions
2. Provide resources
3. Assign responsibilities
4. Set timeline
5. Implement actions
6. Update documentation
7. Inform affected parties

### Monitoring

**AdminSend GmbH monitors:**
- Progress of implementation
- Compliance with deadlines
- Availability of resources
- Emerging problems

**Status Reports:**
- [TODO: e.g., Weekly, monthly]

## Effectiveness Evaluation (10.2.1)

### Evaluation Methods

**Effectiveness evaluated through:**
- Monitoring after implementation
- Checking if NC recurs
- Measuring relevant KPIs
- Audits
- Process monitoring

**Evaluation Period:**
- [TODO: e.g., 3 months after implementation]

### Evaluation Criteria

**Action is effective when:**
- NC does not recur
- Root cause is eliminated
- Process performance is improved
- Goals are achieved

**For ineffective actions:**
1. Repeat root cause analysis
2. Develop alternative actions
3. Implement new actions
4. Re-evaluate

## Update of Risks and Opportunities (10.2.1)

### Risk Assessment

**After nonconformity:**
- Update risk assessment
- Identify new risks
- Adjust risk treatment
- Implement preventive actions

### Opportunity Identification

**Nonconformities can reveal opportunities for:**
- Process improvements
- Product improvements
- Cost reduction
- Efficiency increase

## Changes to QMS (10.2.1)

### System Changes

**If necessary, AdminSend GmbH changes:**
- Processes
- Procedures
- Work instructions
- Forms
- Training content
- Resources

**Change Process:**
1. Identify need for change
2. Plan change
3. Approve change
4. Implement change
5. Update documentation
6. Train affected parties
7. Verify change

## Documented Information (10.2.2)

### Required Records

**AdminSend GmbH retains documented information on:**
- Nature of nonconformities
- Actions taken
- Results of corrective actions
- Root cause analyses
- Effectiveness evaluations

### Retention

**Retention Period:**
- [TODO: e.g., Minimum 5 years or according to statutory requirements]

**Storage Location:**
- [TODO: e.g., Quality management system, document management]

## Nonconformity Register

### Register Content

**Register contains all nonconformities:**

| NC No | Date | Area | Description | Cause | Action | Status | Effectiveness |
|-------|------|------|-------------|-------|--------|--------|---------------|
| [TODO] | [TODO] | [TODO] | [TODO] | [TODO] | [TODO] | [TODO] | [TODO] |

### Evaluation

**Regular Evaluation:**
- Number of NCs per area
- Most frequent NC types
- Trends
- Recurring problems
- Effectiveness of actions

**Evaluation Frequency:**
- [TODO: e.g., Monthly, quarterly]

## Escalation

### Escalation Criteria

**Escalation required for:**
- Critical nonconformities
- Repeated nonconformities
- Nonconformities with high impact
- Delays in action implementation
- Ineffective actions

### Escalation Process

**Escalation Levels:**
1. **Level 1:** Process owner
2. **Level 2:** Quality manager
3. **Level 3:** Top management

**Escalation Timeframe:**
- [TODO: e.g., After 2 weeks without resolution]

## Communication

### Internal Communication

**Nonconformities communicated to:**
- Affected areas
- Process owners
- Quality management
- Top management (for critical NCs)

### External Communication

**If necessary, communicated to:**
