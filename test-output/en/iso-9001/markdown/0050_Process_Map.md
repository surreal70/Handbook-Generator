## Purpose

This document visualizes the process map of the quality management system and describes the interactions between processes. It serves as an overview of the entire QMS and shows how individual processes work together to achieve the intended results.

## Process Map

### Overview

The process map is structured into three main levels:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    MANAGEMENT PROCESSES                      │
│  Strategic Planning | Management Review | Internal Audit    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                      CORE PROCESSES                          │
│  [TODO: Process 1] → [TODO: Process 2] → [TODO: Process 3] │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              ↑
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  SUPPORT PROCESSES                           │
│  HR | Resources | Documentation | IT | Purchasing           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Detailed Process Map

[TODO: Insert detailed process map as diagram here]

**Note:** The process map should be saved as a diagram in the `diagrams/` folder and referenced here.

## Process Flow and Value Chain

### Main Value Chain

```
Customer → Sales → [TODO: Development] → [TODO: Production] → 
[TODO: Quality Control] → [TODO: Shipping] → Customer
```

### Supporting Processes

All core processes are supported by:
- Human resources management (Competent employees)
- Resource management (Infrastructure, equipment)
- Document management (Documented information)
- IT management (IT systems)
- Purchasing (Materials, services)

### Controlling Processes

All processes are controlled by:
- Strategic planning (Directives, objectives)
- Management review (Decisions, resources)
- Internal audit (Monitoring, improvement)

## Interfaces to External Parties

### Customers
**Interfaces:**
- Inquiries and requirements → Sales
- Feedback and complaints → Customer satisfaction
- Delivered products ← Shipping
- After-sales support ← Service

### Suppliers
**Interfaces:**
- Orders → Purchasing
- Deliveries → Goods receipt
- Quality data ← Quality control
- Supplier evaluations ← Supplier management

### Regulatory Authorities
**Interfaces:**
- Compliance requirements → Quality management
- Evidence and reports ← Quality management
- Audits and inspections ↔ Quality management

### Certification Bodies
**Interfaces:**
- Certification audits ↔ Quality management
- Certificates ← Certification body
- Surveillance audits ↔ Quality management

## Process Performance and Monitoring

### Process KPI Overview

| Process | Main KPI | Target Value | Measurement Frequency |
|---------|----------|--------------|----------------------|
| [TODO: Process 1] | [TODO: KPI] | [TODO] | [TODO] |
| [TODO: Process 2] | [TODO: KPI] | [TODO] | [TODO] |
| [TODO: Process 3] | [TODO: KPI] | [TODO] | [TODO] |

### Overall System KPIs

**Quality objectives at system level:**
1. [TODO: e.g., Customer satisfaction > 90%]
2. [TODO: e.g., Scrap rate < 2%]
3. [TODO: e.g., On-time delivery > 95%]
4. [TODO: e.g., Complaint rate < 1%]

## Maintenance and Updates

### Responsibilities

- **Maintenance of process map:** [TODO: Quality management representative]

- Results of management review
- Audit findings

## Appendices

- **Appendix A:** Detailed process map (diagram)
- **Appendix B:** Process interaction matrix
- **Appendix C:** SIPOC diagrams (Supplier-Input-Process-Output-Customer)
