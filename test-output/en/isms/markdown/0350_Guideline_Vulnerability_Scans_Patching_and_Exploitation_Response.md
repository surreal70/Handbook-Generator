## 1. Purpose and Scope

This guideline implements the `0340_Policy_Vulnerability_and_Patch_Management.md` and defines:
- Vulnerability scanning processes and frequencies
- Patch management workflows
- Exploitation response for actively exploited vulnerabilities

**Scope:** All IT systems at **AdminSend GmbH**

## 2. Vulnerability Scanning

### 2.1 Scan Types

**Authenticated Scans:**
- With credentials, deeper analysis
- Detection of configuration weaknesses
- Software inventory and patch level

**Unauthenticated Scans:**
- Without credentials, attacker perspective
- Detection of externally visible vulnerabilities
- Network services and open ports

**Web Application Scans:**
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- SQL injection, XSS, CSRF
- API security tests

### 2.2 Scan Frequencies

| System Type | Authenticated | Unauthenticated | Web App |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|---------|
| Production systems | Weekly | Monthly | Monthly |
| Development systems | Monthly | Quarterly | On deployment |
| Critical infrastructure | Weekly | Weekly | Weekly |
| External systems | N/A | Weekly | Weekly |

**Ad-hoc Scans:**
- After new systems/applications
- After critical vulnerability disclosures
- After security incidents

### 2.3 Scanning Tools

**Vulnerability Scanner:** {{ meta-handbook.security_vuln_scanner }} (e.g., Tenable Nessus, Qualys, Rapid7)  
**Web Application Scanner:** {{ meta-handbook.security_web_scanner }} (e.g., Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP)  
**Container Scanner:** {{ meta-handbook.security_container_scanner }} (e.g., Trivy, Snyk)

### 2.4 Scan Process

1. **Planning:** Define scan time window (outside business hours)
2. **Execution:** Automated scans
3. **Analysis:** Review of results by security team
4. **Prioritization:** Vulnerabilities by severity and exploitability
5. **Remediation:** Ticket creation for IT operations
6. **Verification:** Re-scan after remediation

## 3. Vulnerability Assessment

### 3.1 Severity Classification

**CVSS Score (Common Vulnerability Scoring System):**
- **Critical (9.0-10.0):** Immediate remediation required
- **High (7.0-8.9):** Remediation within 7 days
- **Medium (4.0-6.9):** Remediation within 30 days
- **Low (0.1-3.9):** Remediation within 90 days

### 3.2 Prioritization

**Factors:**
- CVSS score
- Exploitability (exploit available?)
- Asset criticality
- Exposure (internet-facing?)
- Compensating controls present?

**Prioritization Matrix:**
| CVSS | Internet-facing | Exploit Available | Priority | SLA |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|----------|-----|
| Critical | Yes | Yes | P1 | 24 hours |
| Critical | Yes | No | P1 | 48 hours |
| Critical | No | Yes | P2 | 7 days |
| High | Yes | Yes | P2 | 7 days |
| High | No | No | P3 | 30 days |

### 3.3 False Positives

**Process:**
- Security team reviews vulnerability
- If false positive: Mark in scanner
- Document rationale
- Regular review (quarterly)

## 4. Patch Management

### 4.1 Patch Sources

**Operating Systems:**
- Windows: WSUS / Windows Update
- Linux: Package managers (apt, yum, dnf)
- macOS: Software Update

**Applications:**
- Vendor updates
- Third-party patch management (e.g., Ninite, Chocolatey)

**Firmware:**
- Vendor portals
- Automatic update checks

### 4.2 Patch Process

**Phase 1: Patch Identification**
- Automatic notifications from vendors
- Vulnerability scan results
- Security advisories (CVE, CERT)

**Phase 2: Assessment and Prioritization**
- Check relevance for own systems
- Assess severity and exploitability
- Prioritize according to Section 3.2

**Phase 3: Testing**
- Test in dev/test environment
- Compatibility check
- Create rollback plan

**Phase 4: Deployment**
- Staging: Pilot group (10% of systems)
- Monitor for issues (24 hours)
- Rollout: Remaining systems
- Verification: Patch successfully installed?

**Phase 5: Verification**
- Re-scan to confirm remediation
- Documentation in ticketing system

### 4.3 Patch Windows

**Maintenance Windows:**
- **Production systems:** Sunday 02:00-06:00
- **Development systems:** Daily outside business hours
- **Critical patches:** Emergency maintenance window as needed

**Automatic Patching:**
- Workstations: Automatic, outside business hours
- Servers: Manual after testing
- Critical systems: Change approval required

### 4.4 Emergency Patching

**Triggers:**
- Actively exploited exploit (zero-day)
- Critical vulnerability in internet-facing system
- Ransomware campaign

**Process:**
1. **Immediate Assessment:** Identify affected systems
2. **Emergency Change:** Accelerated approval
3. **Minimal Testing:** Test only critical functions
4. **Immediate Deployment:** Within 24 hours
5. **Monitoring:** Enhanced monitoring after patch

## 5. Exploitation Response

### 5.1 Threat Intelligence

**Sources:**
- **CISA KEV (Known Exploited Vulnerabilities):** https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog
- **CERT-Bund:** https://www.cert-bund.de/
- **Vendor Security Advisories**
- **Threat Intelligence Feeds:** {{ meta-handbook.security_threat_intel }}

**Monitoring:**
- Daily check for new exploits
- Automatic alerts for critical vulnerabilities
- Cross-reference with own systems

### 5.2 Zero-Day Response

**Process:**
1. **Detection:** Threat intelligence or IDS/IPS alert
2. **Assessment:** Identify affected systems
3. **Containment:** Immediate measures to minimize risk
4. **Mitigation:** Workarounds or compensating controls
5. **Patching:** As soon as patch available
6. **Lessons Learned:** Post-incident review

**Immediate Measures (Containment):**
- Network segmentation (firewall rules)
- Disable affected services
- Update IDS/IPS signatures
- Enhanced monitoring

### 5.3 Compensating Controls

**When Patching Not Immediately Possible:**
- **Network Isolation:** Isolate affected systems
- **WAF Rules:** Web Application Firewall rules
- **IPS Signatures:** Intrusion Prevention System
- **Access Restrictions:** Only authorized users
- **Enhanced Monitoring:** SIEM alerts for exploitation attempts

**Documentation:**
- Rationale for delayed patching
- Implemented compensating controls
- Risk assessment
- Planned patch date

## 6. Vulnerability Disclosure

### 6.1 Responsible Disclosure

**Process for External Researchers:**
1. **Report:** security@[TODO]
2. **Acknowledgment:** Within 24 hours
3. **Assessment:** Within 7 days
4. **Remediation:** According to severity SLA
5. **Disclosure:** Coordinated with researcher (90 days)

**Bug Bounty Program (Optional):**
- Platform: {{ meta-handbook.security_bug_bounty }} (e.g., HackerOne, Bugcrowd)
- Scope: Defined systems and applications
- Rewards: By severity

### 6.2 Vendor Disclosure

**For Vulnerabilities in Vendor Products:**
1. Report to vendor
2. Coordinate with vendor for patch
3. No public disclosure before patch availability
4. Implement workarounds

## 7. Compliance and Audit

### 7.1 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| Metric | Target Value |
|--------|--------------|
| Critical patches (SLA compliance) | > 95% |
| Scan coverage | 100% of all systems |
| Mean time to patch (critical) | < 7 days |
| Open critical vulnerabilities | < 5 |

### 7.2 Reporting

**Monthly Vulnerability Report:**
- Number of vulnerabilities by severity

- Vulnerability posture
- Risk development
- Improvement measures

### 7.3 Audit Evidence
