## Purpose

This document describes the Evaluate-Direct-Monitor (EDM) model, which forms the core of IT governance according to ISO/IEC 38500.

## Scope

This document applies to:
- AdminSend GmbH
- All IT governance processes
- Board, Executive Management, and IT Management

## EDM Model Overview

The EDM model defines three main IT governance activities:

### Evaluate

Assessment of current and future IT use to support the organization.

**Activities:**
- Analyze business requirements
- Assess IT capabilities
- Review options and alternatives
- Identify risks and opportunities
- Understand stakeholder needs

**Responsible:** Board and Executive Management

### Direct

Preparation, communication, and implementation of plans and policies.

**Activities:**
- Define IT strategy
- Develop policies
- Allocate resources
- Define responsibilities
- Set priorities

**Responsible:** Executive Management and IT Leadership

### Monitor

Monitoring of compliance with policies and performance against plans.

**Activities:**
- Measure performance
- Monitor compliance
- Identify deviations
- Create reports
- Initiate corrective actions

**Responsible:** Board, Executive Management, and IT Management

## EDM Cycle

```
Evaluate → Direct → Monitor → Evaluate (continuous cycle)
```

The EDM cycle is continuous and iterative:
1. **Evaluate**: Assess current situation
2. **Direct**: Provide direction and guide actions
3. **Monitor**: Monitor implementation and results
4. **Back to Evaluate**: Use insights for next assessment

## EDM Application to Governance Principles

| Principle | Evaluate | Direct | Monitor |
|-----------|----------|--------|---------|
| Responsibility | Assess responsibilities | Assign responsibilities | Monitor fulfillment |
| Strategy | Review strategic alignment | Communicate strategy | Monitor strategy implementation |
| Acquisition | Assess acquisition needs | Direct acquisition process | Monitor acquisition results |
| Performance | Assess performance requirements | Set performance targets | Measure performance |
