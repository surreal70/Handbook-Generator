- Lead Time for Changes

**Current Performance**:
- Deployment Frequency: [TODO]
- Lead Time: [TODO]

### Stability

Measured by:
- Mean Time to Restore (MTTR)
- Change Failure Rate

**Current Performance**:
- MTTR: [TODO]
- Change Failure Rate: [TODO]

## Measurement Methods

### Automated Data Collection

- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Monitoring tools
- Incident management systems
- Version control systems

### Data Sources
