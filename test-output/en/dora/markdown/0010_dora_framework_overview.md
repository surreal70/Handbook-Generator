## Purpose

This document provides an overview of the DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) Framework and its application for measuring and improving software delivery performance.

## Scope

This document covers:
- Introduction to DORA Metrics
- The four key metrics
- Performance categories
- Application areas

## DORA Framework Introduction

### Background

The DORA program was developed by Dr. Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim, based on years of research into software delivery performance. The research identified four key metrics that strongly correlate with organizational performance.

### Organization Information

- **Organization**: [TODO]
- **Responsible**: [TODO]
- **Implementation Date**: [TODO]

## The Four Key Metrics

### 1. Deployment Frequency

Measures how often an organization successfully deploys code to production.

**Performance Levels**:
- Elite: On-demand (multiple times per day)
- High: Between once per day and once per week
- Medium: Between once per week and once per month
- Low: Between once per month and once every six months

### 2. Lead Time for Changes

Measures the time from code commit to successful execution in production.

**Performance Levels**:
- Elite: Less than one hour
- High: Between one day and one week
- Medium: Between one month and six months
- Low: More than six months

### 3. Mean Time to Restore (MTTR)

Measures the average time to restore service after an incident.

**Performance Levels**:
- Elite: Less than one hour
- High: Less than one day
- Medium: Between one day and one week
- Low: More than one week

### 4. Change Failure Rate

Measures the percentage of deployments that result in degraded service and require remediation.

**Performance Levels**:
- Elite: 0-15%
- High: 16-30%
- Medium: 31-45%
- Low: 46-60%

## Performance Categories

### Elite Performers

Organizations achieving elite performance across all four metrics demonstrate:
- Higher profitability
- Higher market share
- Higher productivity
- Higher customer satisfaction

### High Performers

Organizations with high performance show significant advantages over medium and low performers.

### Medium and Low Performers

These organizations have clear improvement opportunities and should implement systematic improvement programs.

## Application Areas

### Software Development

- Measuring development velocity
- Identifying bottlenecks
- Improving code quality

### DevOps Transformation

- Assessing DevOps maturity
- Tracking transformation progress
- Benchmarking against industry standards

### Continuous Improvement

- Identifying improvement opportunities
- Prioritizing initiatives
- Measuring improvement success

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Baseline Measurement

Establishing current performance baseline for all four metrics.

### Phase 2: Analysis

Identifying improvement opportunities and bottlenecks.

### Phase 3: Improvement

Implementing targeted improvement measures.

### Phase 4: Monitoring

Continuous monitoring and adjustment.

## Success Factors

- **Leadership Support**: Commitment from management and leadership
- **Cultural Change**: Fostering a learning and experimentation culture
- **Automation**: Investment in CI/CD and automation
- **Measurability**: Establishing reliable measurement systems
- **Continuity**: Long-term commitment to improvement
