## Purpose

This document describes the "Inclusive" and "Dynamic" principles of ISO 31000 risk management.

## Principle 4: Inclusive

## Principle 5: Dynamic

### Key Statements

## Integration of Both Principles

The combination of inclusive and dynamic risk management enables:
- Early detection of changes through stakeholder input
- Quick response through broad knowledge base
- Acceptance of measures through involvement
- Continuous improvement through feedback
