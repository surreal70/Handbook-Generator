## Purpose

This document describes the implementation of the principle of accuracy in AdminSend GmbH. Personal data must be accurate and up to date.

## Principle according to Art. 5(1)(d) GDPR

**Legal Requirement:**  
Personal data must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay.

### Two Components

1. **Factual Accuracy:** Data must correspond to facts
2. **Currency:** Data must be kept up to date

## Measures to Ensure Accuracy

### Data Quality Management

**Quality Assurance Processes:**

| Measure | Description | Responsible | Frequency |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| [TODO: Input Validation] | Check at data entry | IT | Continuous |
| [TODO: Plausibility Check] | Automatic consistency check | IT | Continuous |
| [TODO: Data Reconciliation] | Comparison with external sources | Department | [TODO: Monthly] |
| [TODO: Update Reminder] | Reminder for data update | IT | [TODO: Annually] |

### Input Validation

**Technical Measures at Data Entry:**
- [TODO: Format validation (email, phone, postal code)]
- [TODO: Mandatory field validation]
- [TODO: Value range validation]
- [TODO: Duplicate check]
- [TODO: Consistency check between fields]

### Data Updates

**Processes for Currency Assurance:**

| Data Type | Update Process | Frequency | Responsible |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|-------------|
| [TODO: Customer master data] | [TODO: Update on contact] | As needed | Sales |
| [TODO: Employee data] | [TODO: Annual review] | Annually | HR |
| [TODO: Contact data] | [TODO: Validation on use] | On use | IT |
| [TODO: Contract data] | [TODO: Update on contract change] | On change | Legal |

## Right to Rectification (Art. 16 GDPR)

### Implementation of Rectification Right

**Data subjects have the right to:**
- Immediate rectification of inaccurate data
- Completion of incomplete data
- Supplementary statement

**Process for Rectification Requests:**

1. **Receipt of Request**
   - Identification of data subject
   - Documentation of request
   - Confirmation of receipt

2. **Review of Inaccuracy**
   - Verification of contested data
   - Comparison with evidence
   - Decision on rectification

3. **Implementation of Rectification**
   - Correction in all systems
   - Information to recipients (Art. 19)
   - Documentation of rectification

4. **Response to Data Subject**
   - Information about rectification performed
   - Deadline: Without delay, at most 1 month

### Rectification Channels

| Channel | Description | Processing Time | Responsible |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| [TODO: Online Portal] | Self-rectification by user | Immediate | IT |
| [TODO: Email] | Request by email | 1 month | DPO |
| [TODO: Written] | Request by mail | 1 month | DPO |
| [TODO: Phone] | Telephone rectification | Immediate | Customer Service |

## Error Correction Procedures

### Error Identification

**Error Sources:**
- Input errors during data capture
- Outdated data due to time lapse
- Faulty data transmission
- System errors in data processing
- Incomplete data collection

**Error Detection:**
- [TODO: Automatic plausibility check]
- [TODO: Report by data subjects]
- [TODO: Regular data quality check]
- [TODO: Feedback from recipients]

### Correction Process

**Steps Upon Error Detection:**

1. **Error Analysis**
   - Type of error
   - Scope of impact
   - Cause of error

2. **Error Correction**
   - Rectification of erroneous data
   - Correction in all affected systems
   - Documentation of correction

3. **Notification**
   - Information to data subject
   - Communication to recipients (Art. 19)
   - Documentation of notifications

4. **Root Cause Elimination**
   - Analysis of error cause
   - Measures for error prevention
   - Process improvement

## Notification Obligation (Art. 19 GDPR)

### Notification of Recipients

**Recipients must be informed of rectification or erasure:**

| Recipient Type | Notification Obligation | Exception | Documentation |
|----------------|------------------------|-----------|---------------|
| Processors | Yes | Impossible/disproportionate | Notification log |
| Third Party Recipients | Yes | Impossible/disproportionate | Notification log |
| Public Authorities | Yes | Impossible/disproportionate | Notification log |

**Process:**
1. Identification of all recipients
2. Notification of rectification/erasure
3. Documentation of notifications
4. Information to data subject about recipients (on request)

## Data Quality Controls

### Regular Reviews

| Control | Frequency | Responsible | Documentation |
|---------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Data Quality Audit | Annually | DPO | Audit report |
| Sample Check | Quarterly | Department | Review protocol |
| System Validation | On changes | IT | Test protocol |
| Rectification Statistics | Monthly | DPO | Statistics report |

### Quality Metrics

**KPIs for Data Quality:**
- Error rate in data entry
- Number of rectification requests
- Average processing time
- Proportion of outdated records
- Completeness level of data

## Documentation

### Evidence Requirements

**Documentation for Accountability:**
- Processes to ensure accuracy
- Rectification procedures and deadlines
- Processed rectification requests
- Notifications to recipients
- Data quality controls and their results

### Rectification Register

| Date | Data Subject | Type of Rectification | Recipients Notified | Processor |
|------|--------------|----------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| [TODO] | [TODO] | [TODO] | Yes/No | [TODO] |

## Common Violations and Their Prevention

| Violation | Example | Prevention |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| Outdated data | No updates | Regular review |
| Erroneous input | No validation | Input validation |
| Delayed rectification | Long processing time | Process optimization |
| Missing notification | Recipients not informed | Notification process |

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement input validation and plausibility checks
2. Establish processes for regular data updates
3. Set up rectification procedures according to Art. 16
4. Implement notification process for recipients
5. Conduct regular data quality controls
