## Overview

This glossary defines all important terms, abbreviations, and acronyms used in the Security Target. It serves as a central reference for terminology and ensures that all terms are used consistently.



## Common Criteria Standard Terms



### A

**Asset**
[TODO: Definition or reference to ISO/IEC 15408-1]
An asset is an entity that has value to the owner or user and therefore must be protected.

**Assumption**
[TODO: Definition or reference to ISO/IEC 15408-1]
An assumption is a statement about the security aspects of the TOE environment that is assumed to be true.

**Attack Potential**
[TODO: Definition or reference to ISO/IEC 18045]
Attack potential is a measure of an attacker's ability to conduct a successful attack.

**Augmentation**
[TODO: Definition or reference to ISO/IEC 15408-1]
Augmentation is the addition of requirements to an EAL that exceed the standard requirements.

### C

**Common Criteria (CC)**
[TODO: Definition]
ISO/IEC 15408 - International standard for evaluating the security of IT products and systems.

### E

**Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL)**
[TODO: Definition or reference to ISO/IEC 15408-3]
An EAL is a package of security assurance requirements (SARs) that represents a specific level of confidence in the security of the TOE.

**Evaluation Authority**
[TODO: Definition]
An organization responsible for overseeing and certifying Common Criteria evaluations.

### O

**Organizational Security Policy (OSP)**
[TODO: Definition or reference to ISO/IEC 15408-1]
An OSP is a security policy imposed by an organization that must be enforced by the TOE.

### P

**Protection Profile (PP)**
[TODO: Definition or reference to ISO/IEC 15408-1]
A PP is an implementation-independent set of security requirements for a category of TOEs.

### S

**Security Assurance Requirement (SAR)**
[TODO: Definition or reference to ISO/IEC 15408-3]
A SAR is a requirement that ensures confidence in the correct implementation of security functions.

**Security Functional Requirement (SFR)**
[TODO: Definition or reference to ISO/IEC 15408-2]
An SFR is a requirement that describes a security function that the TOE must provide.

**Security Objective**
[TODO: Definition or reference to ISO/IEC 15408-1]
A security objective is a statement of the intended response to identified threats and/or OSPs.

**Security Target (ST)**
[TODO: Definition or reference to ISO/IEC 15408-1]
An ST is an implementation-specific set of security requirements and specifications for a concrete TOE.

**Strength of Function (SOF)**
[TODO: Definition or reference to ISO/IEC 15408-1]
SOF is a measure of the effectiveness of a security function against direct attacks.

### T

**Target of Evaluation (TOE)**
[TODO: Definition or reference to ISO/IEC 15408-1]
The TOE is the IT product or system being evaluated.

**Threat**
[TODO: Definition or reference to ISO/IEC 15408-1]
A threat is a potential violation of security by an attacker.

**Threat Agent**
[TODO: Definition or reference to ISO/IEC 15408-1]
A threat agent is an entity that can execute a threat.

**TSF (TOE Security Functionality)**
[TODO: Definition or reference to ISO/IEC 15408-1]
The TSF is the totality of all hardware, software, and firmware components of the TOE responsible for enforcing the security policy.

**TSP (TOE Security Policy)**
[TODO: Definition or reference to ISO/IEC 15408-1]
The TSP is the set of rules that govern the security of the TOE.
