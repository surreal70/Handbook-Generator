## Overview

This chapter provides the rationale demonstrating that the defined security objectives completely and adequately address the identified security problems (threats, Organizational Security Policies, assumptions).



## Rationale Methodology



### Approach

[TODO: Describe the systematic approach to creating the rationale]

**Steps:**
1. Identification of all security problems (threats, OSPs, assumptions)
2. Mapping of security objectives to each security problem
3. Justification of completeness and adequacy
4. Review for gaps and redundancies

### Completeness Criteria



[TODO: Define when the security objectives are considered complete]

**Criteria:**
- Each threat is addressed by at least one TOE security objective
- Each OSP is addressed by at least one TOE security objective
- Each assumption is addressed by at least one environmental security objective
- No security problems remain unaddressed

## Rationale for Threats



### Threat T.1: [TODO: Threat Name]

**Threat Description:**
[TODO: Brief summary of the threat from section 0210]

**Addressing Security Objectives:**

#### Security Objective O.1: [TODO: Objective Name]

**Justification:**
[TODO: Explain in detail how this security objective addresses the threat]

**Adequacy:**
[TODO: Justify why this security objective is sufficient to mitigate the threat]

#### Security Objective O.2: [TODO: Objective Name] (if applicable)

**Justification:**
[TODO: Explain the additional coverage by this objective]

**Adequacy:**
[TODO: Justify the necessity of this additional objective]

**Summary:**
[TODO: Summarize how the combination of security objectives completely addresses the threat]

### Threat T.2: [TODO: Threat Name]

**Threat Description:**
[TODO: Brief summary]

**Addressing Security Objectives:**

#### Security Objective O.X: [TODO: Objective Name]

**Justification:**
[TODO: Detailed explanation]

**Adequacy:**
[TODO: Justification of adequacy]

**Summary:**
[TODO: Summary of coverage]

### Additional Threats



[TODO: Document the rationale for all additional threats]

## Rationale for Organizational Security Policies (OSPs)



### OSP P.1: [TODO: OSP Name]

**OSP Description:**
[TODO: Brief summary of the OSP from section 0220]

**Addressing Security Objectives:**

#### Security Objective O.X: [TODO: Objective Name]

**Justification:**
[TODO: Explain how this security objective implements or supports the OSP]

**Adequacy:**
[TODO: Justify why this security objective is sufficient to fulfill the OSP]

**Summary:**
[TODO: Summarize the fulfillment of the OSP]

### OSP P.2: [TODO: OSP Name]

**OSP Description:**
[TODO: Brief summary]

**Addressing Security Objectives:**

#### Security Objective O.X: [TODO: Objective Name]

**Justification:**
[TODO: Detailed explanation]

**Adequacy:**
[TODO: Justification of adequacy]

**Summary:**
[TODO: Summary of fulfillment]

### Additional OSPs



[TODO: Document the rationale for all additional OSPs]

## Rationale for Assumptions



### Assumption A.1: [TODO: Assumption Name]

**Assumption Description:**
[TODO: Brief summary of the assumption from section 0230]

**Addressing Security Objectives:**

#### Environmental Security Objective OE.X: [TODO: Objective Name]

**Justification:**
[TODO: Explain how this environmental security objective supports or ensures the assumption]

**Adequacy:**
[TODO: Justify why this objective is sufficient to justify the assumption]

**Summary:**
[TODO: Summarize the support of the assumption]

### Assumption A.2: [TODO: Assumption Name]

**Assumption Description:**
[TODO: Brief summary]

**Addressing Security Objectives:**

#### Environmental Security Objective OE.X: [TODO: Objective Name]

**Justification:**
[TODO: Detailed explanation]

**Adequacy:**
[TODO: Justification of adequacy]

**Summary:**
[TODO: Summary of support]

### Additional Assumptions



[TODO: Document the rationale for all additional assumptions]

## Completeness Analysis



### Coverage Matrix: Security Problems to Security Objectives



| Security Problem | Type | Addressing Security Objectives | Status |
|------------------|------|-------------------------------|--------|
| T.1: [TODO] | Threat | O.1, O.2 | Complete |
| T.2: [TODO] | Threat | O.3 | Complete |
| P.1: [TODO] | OSP | O.4, O.5 | Complete |
| P.2: [TODO] | OSP | O.6 | Complete |
| A.1: [TODO] | Assumption | OE.1 | Complete |
| A.2: [TODO] | Assumption | OE.2, OE.3 | Complete |

**Legend:**
- **Complete:** All aspects of the security problem are addressed
- **Partial:** Some aspects are addressed, additional objectives required
- **Incomplete:** Security problem is not sufficiently addressed

### Identified Gaps



[TODO: List all security problems that are not completely addressed by security objectives]

**Gap 1:** [TODO: Description]
- **Affected Security Problem:** [TODO]
- **Missing Coverage:** [TODO]
- **Planned Action:** [TODO: Additional objective or justification why no action is required]

### Redundancy Analysis



[TODO: Analyze whether security objectives are redundant or overlap]

**Redundancy 1:** [TODO: Description]
- **Affected Objectives:** [TODO: O.X, O.Y]
- **Overlap:** [TODO: Describe the overlap]
- **Justification:** [TODO: Explain why both objectives are necessary, or suggest consolidation]

## Adequacy Analysis



### Assessment Criteria

[TODO: Define the criteria for adequacy of security objectives]

**Criteria:**
- Security objectives address the root cause of threats
- Security objectives are realistically implementable
- Security objectives are measurable and verifiable
- Security objectives are proportional to the risk

### Adequacy Assessment



| Security Objective | Addressed Problems | Adequacy | Justification |
|--------------------|-------------------|----------|---------------|
| O.1: [TODO] | T.1, T.2 | Adequate | [TODO: Justification] |
| O.2: [TODO] | T.1, P.1 | Adequate | [TODO: Justification] |
| O.3: [TODO] | T.3 | To Review | [TODO: Justification] |

**Legend:**
- **Adequate:** Objective is sufficient to address the problem
- **To Review:** Further analysis required
- **Insufficient:** Objective must be strengthened or supplemented

## Rationale Summary



### Completeness

[TODO: Confirm that all security problems are addressed by security objectives]

**Status:** [TODO: Complete / Incomplete]

**Justification:**

### Adequacy

[TODO: Confirm that the security objectives are adequate]

**Status:** [TODO: Adequate / Needs Improvement]

**Justification:**

### Consistency

[TODO: Confirm that the security objectives are consistent and non-contradictory]

**Status:** [TODO: Consistent / Inconsistencies Present]

**Justification:**
[TODO: Explain the consistency status]
