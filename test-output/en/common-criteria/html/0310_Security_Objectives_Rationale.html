<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>This document provides the rationale (justification) for the security objectives of the TOE <strong>{{ meta-handbook.toe_name }}</strong> and its operational environment. The rationale demonstrates that the defined security objectives are sufficient and appropriate to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Counter all identified threats</li>
<li>Implement all organizational security policies (OSPs)</li>
<li>Fulfill all assumptions about the operational environment</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="11-purpose">1.1 Purpose</h3>
<p>The rationale serves as proof of:
- <strong>Completeness</strong>: All elements of the security problem definition are covered by objectives
- <strong>Appropriateness</strong>: Each objective is suitable to address the assigned threats/OSPs/assumptions
- <strong>Traceability</strong>: Clear connection between security problems and objectives</p>
<h3 id="12-methodology">1.2 Methodology</h3>
<p>For each security objective, the following is documented:
1. Which threats, OSPs, or assumptions it addresses
2. How it counters these security problems
3. Why it is appropriate and sufficient</p>
<h2 id="2-rationale-for-toe-security-objectives">2. Rationale for TOE Security Objectives</h2>
<h3 id="21-oaccess_control">2.1 O.ACCESS_CONTROL</h3>
<p><strong>Addressed Threats:</strong>
- T.UNAUTHORIZED_ACCESS: Unauthorized access to protected resources
- T.PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION: Gaining higher privileges</p>
<p><strong>Addressed OSPs:</strong>
- P.ACCESS_CONTROL: Access must be controlled based on permissions</p>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong>
The objective O.ACCESS_CONTROL counters the threats T.UNAUTHORIZED_ACCESS and T.PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION by ensuring that the TOE controls access to protected resources based on user identity and assigned permissions. Only authenticated users with appropriate permissions can access resources. This implements the organizational security policy P.ACCESS_CONTROL, which mandates role-based access control.</p>
<p><strong>[TODO: Adapt the rationale to your specific TOE]</strong></p>
<h3 id="22-oidentification_authentication">2.2 O.IDENTIFICATION_AUTHENTICATION</h3>
<p><strong>Addressed Threats:</strong>
- T.MASQUERADE: Impersonating a false identity</p>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong>
The objective O.IDENTIFICATION_AUTHENTICATION counters the threat T.MASQUERADE by ensuring that all users are uniquely identified and authenticated before access to protected functions is granted. This prevents attackers from impersonating legitimate users. The objective also supports O.ACCESS_CONTROL, as reliable identification is a prerequisite for effective access control.</p>
<p><strong>[TODO: Add additional details about authentication]</strong></p>
<h3 id="23-oaudit_generation">2.3 O.AUDIT_GENERATION</h3>
<p><strong>Addressed Threats:</strong>
- T.AUDIT_COMPROMISE: Manipulation or deletion of audit data</p>
<p><strong>Addressed OSPs:</strong>
- P.ACCOUNTABILITY: User actions must be traceable</p>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong>
The objective O.AUDIT_GENERATION partially counters the threat T.AUDIT_COMPROMISE by ensuring that security-relevant events are recorded. Recording enables traceability of user actions and security events, which implements the organizational security policy P.ACCOUNTABILITY. In combination with O.AUDIT_PROTECTION, complete protection of audit data is achieved.</p>
<p><strong>[TODO: Define which events are recorded]</strong></p>
<h3 id="24-oaudit_protection">2.4 O.AUDIT_PROTECTION</h3>
<p><strong>Addressed Threats:</strong>
- T.AUDIT_COMPROMISE: Manipulation or deletion of audit data</p>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong>
The objective O.AUDIT_PROTECTION counters the threat T.AUDIT_COMPROMISE by ensuring that audit records are protected from unauthorized modification and deletion. This guarantees the integrity and availability of audit data required for forensic analysis and compliance evidence. The objective complements O.AUDIT_GENERATION and ensures complete audit protection.</p>
<p><strong>[TODO: Describe protection mechanisms]</strong></p>
<h3 id="25-odata_confidentiality">2.5 O.DATA_CONFIDENTIALITY</h3>
<p><strong>Addressed Threats:</strong>
- T.DATA_DISCLOSURE: Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data
- T.EAVESDROPPING: Eavesdropping on data transmissions</p>
<p><strong>Addressed OSPs:</strong>
- P.CONFIDENTIALITY: Sensitive data must be treated confidentially</p>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong>
The objective O.DATA_CONFIDENTIALITY counters the threats T.DATA_DISCLOSURE and T.EAVESDROPPING by ensuring that sensitive user data is protected from unauthorized disclosure. This is achieved through access control, encryption, and secure data transmission. The objective implements the organizational security policy P.CONFIDENTIALITY, which mandates the protection of confidential information.</p>
<p><strong>[TODO: Specify protected data types]</strong></p>
<h3 id="26-ocryptographic_operations">2.6 O.CRYPTOGRAPHIC_OPERATIONS</h3>
<p><strong>Addressed Threats:</strong>
- T.DATA_DISCLOSURE: Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data
- T.DATA_MODIFICATION: Unauthorized modification of data</p>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong>
The objective O.CRYPTOGRAPHIC_OPERATIONS supports O.DATA_CONFIDENTIALITY and O.DATA_INTEGRITY by providing cryptographic mechanisms for encryption and integrity protection of data. Cryptographic operations protect data both at rest and in transit from disclosure and manipulation.</p>
<p><strong>[TODO: Define required cryptographic algorithms]</strong></p>
<h3 id="27-odata_integrity">2.7 O.DATA_INTEGRITY</h3>
<p><strong>Addressed Threats:</strong>
- T.DATA_MODIFICATION: Unauthorized modification of data
- T.DATA_CORRUPTION: Corruption of data</p>
<p><strong>Addressed OSPs:</strong>
- P.INTEGRITY: Data integrity must be ensured</p>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong>
The objective O.DATA_INTEGRITY counters the threats T.DATA_MODIFICATION and T.DATA_CORRUPTION by ensuring that user data and system data are protected from unauthorized modification. This is achieved through integrity checks, access control, and cryptographic mechanisms. The objective implements the organizational security policy P.INTEGRITY.</p>
<p><strong>[TODO: Describe integrity protection mechanisms]</strong></p>
<h3 id="28-osecurity_management">2.8 O.SECURITY_MANAGEMENT</h3>
<p><strong>Addressed OSPs:</strong>
- P.MANAGEMENT: Security functions must be manageable</p>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong>
The objective O.SECURITY_MANAGEMENT implements the organizational security policy P.MANAGEMENT by enabling authorized administrators to manage security functions and policies. This includes configuration of access control policies, audit settings, and other security parameters. Effective management is a prerequisite for maintaining security throughout the TOE lifecycle.</p>
<p><strong>[TODO: Define management functions]</strong></p>
<h3 id="29-osecure_state">2.9 O.SECURE_STATE</h3>
<p><strong>Addressed Threats:</strong>
- T.MALFUNCTION: Malfunction of the TOE</p>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong>
The objective O.SECURE_STATE counters the threat T.MALFUNCTION by ensuring that the TOE starts in a secure state and transitions to a secure state upon errors. This prevents malfunctions from leading to security violations. The TOE must maintain its security properties even during unexpected events.</p>
<p><strong>[TODO: Describe secure states]</strong></p>
<h3 id="210-otsf_protection">2.10 O.TSF_PROTECTION</h3>
<p><strong>Addressed Threats:</strong>
- T.TSF_COMPROMISE: Tampering with security functions
- T.TSF_BYPASS: Bypassing security functions</p>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong>
The objective O.TSF_PROTECTION counters the threats T.TSF_COMPROMISE and T.TSF_BYPASS by ensuring that the security functions (TSF) of the TOE are protected from tampering and bypass. This is fundamental to the effectiveness of all other security objectives, as compromised security functions would render all protection mechanisms ineffective.</p>
<p><strong>[TODO: Describe TSF protection mechanisms]</strong></p>
<h3 id="211-additional-toe-security-objectives">2.11 Additional TOE Security Objectives</h3>
<p><strong>[TODO: Add rationale for additional specific security objectives]</strong></p>
<h4 id="ocustom_objective_1">O.[CUSTOM_OBJECTIVE_1]</h4>
<p><strong>Addressed Threats/OSPs:</strong>
- [TODO: List threats/OSPs]</p>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong>
[TODO: Explain how the objective counters the threats/OSPs]</p>
<h2 id="3-rationale-for-environment-objectives">3. Rationale for Environment Objectives</h2>
<h3 id="31-oephysical_protection">3.1 OE.PHYSICAL_PROTECTION</h3>
<p><strong>Fulfilled Assumptions:</strong>
- A.PHYSICAL_SECURITY: The TOE is operated in a physically secured environment</p>
<p><strong>Addressed Threats:</strong>
- T.PHYSICAL_ATTACK: Physical attack on the TOE</p>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong>
The objective OE.PHYSICAL_PROTECTION fulfills the assumption A.PHYSICAL_SECURITY by ensuring that the operational environment protects the TOE from physical access by unauthorized persons. This also counters the threat T.PHYSICAL_ATTACK. Physical protection measures such as access controls, surveillance, and secure facilities prevent attackers from gaining direct access to the hardware.</p>
<p><strong>[TODO: Define required physical protection measures]</strong></p>
<h3 id="32-oetrusted_admin">3.2 OE.TRUSTED_ADMIN</h3>
<p><strong>Fulfilled Assumptions:</strong>
- A.TRUSTED_ADMIN: Administrators are trustworthy and competent</p>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong>
The objective OE.TRUSTED_ADMIN fulfills the assumption A.TRUSTED_ADMIN by ensuring that administrators are trustworthy, trained, and competent. This reduces the risk of insider threats and misconfigurations. Trustworthy administrators are essential as they have extensive privileges and could bypass security mechanisms.</p>
<p><strong>[TODO: Describe requirements for administrators]</strong></p>
<h3 id="33-oeuser_training">3.3 OE.USER_TRAINING</h3>
<p><strong>Fulfilled Assumptions:</strong>
- A.USER_TRAINING: Users are trained in the secure use of the TOE</p>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong>
The objective OE.USER_TRAINING fulfills the assumption A.USER_TRAINING by ensuring that users are trained in the secure use of the TOE. This reduces the risk of user errors, social engineering, and unintentional security violations. Trained users understand security policies and can recognize suspicious activities.</p>
<p><strong>[TODO: Define training requirements]</strong></p>
<h3 id="34-oenetwork_protection">3.4 OE.NETWORK_PROTECTION</h3>
<p><strong>Fulfilled Assumptions:</strong>
- A.NETWORK_SECURITY: The network is protected by firewalls and other mechanisms</p>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong>
The objective OE.NETWORK_PROTECTION fulfills the assumption A.NETWORK_SECURITY by ensuring that the operational environment protects the TOE from network attacks. Firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and network segmentation reduce the attack surface and prevent unauthorized network access to the TOE.</p>
<p><strong>[TODO: Specify required network protection measures]</strong></p>
<h3 id="35-oeexternal_systems">3.5 OE.EXTERNAL_SYSTEMS</h3>
<p><strong>Fulfilled Assumptions:</strong>
- A.EXTERNAL_SYSTEMS: External systems are trustworthy and secure</p>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong>
The objective OE.EXTERNAL_SYSTEMS fulfills the assumption A.EXTERNAL_SYSTEMS by ensuring that external systems with which the TOE interacts are trustworthy and secure. This reduces risks from compromised third-party components or insecure interfaces. The environment must assess and monitor the security of external systems.</p>
<p><strong>[TODO: Define requirements for external systems]</strong></p>
<h3 id="36-oetime_stamps">3.6 OE.TIME_STAMPS</h3>
<p><strong>Fulfilled Assumptions:</strong>
- A.TIME_SOURCE: A reliable time source is available</p>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong>
The objective OE.TIME_STAMPS fulfills the assumption A.TIME_SOURCE by ensuring that the operational environment provides reliable timestamps for audit records and security events. Accurate timestamps are essential for forensic analysis, event correlation, and compliance evidence. The objective supports O.AUDIT_GENERATION.</p>
<p><strong>[TODO: Describe requirements for time sources]</strong></p>
<h3 id="37-additional-environment-objectives">3.7 Additional Environment Objectives</h3>
<p><strong>[TODO: Add rationale for additional environment objectives]</strong></p>
<h4 id="oecustom_env_objective">OE.[CUSTOM_ENV_OBJECTIVE]</h4>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> All security objectives are justified. ✓</p>
<h2 id="5-summary">5. Summary</h2>
<p>The rationale demonstrates that the defined security objectives are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Complete</strong>: All threats, OSPs, and assumptions are covered</li>
<li><strong>Appropriate</strong>: Each objective is suitable to counter the assigned security problems</li>
<li><strong>Traceable</strong>: Each objective can be traced back to security problems</li>
<li><strong>Consistent</strong>: No contradictions between objectives</li>
</ol>
<p>The security objectives form a solid foundation for deriving the security requirements (SFRs and SARs) in the next step of the Security Target.</p>
<h2 id="6-next-steps">6. Next Steps</h2>
<p>After the rationale for security objectives:
1. Create the Coverage Matrix (see Template 0320)
2. Derive the security requirements (SFRs and SARs) from the objectives (see Template 0400-0450)</p>
